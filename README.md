# Music-WebApp
The Music App is a music playlist management platform designed to offer a seamless and interactive experience for music enthusiasts. It allows users to browse, create, and manage personalized music playlists. Built with Angular, the frontend provides a dynamic and responsive user interface, enhancing user interaction with the application. The backend, developed using ASP.NET, ensures robust server-side processing and efficient handling of application logic, including user requests and data management. The application utilizes MySQL for its database needs, effectively storing and retrieving data related to user profiles, playlists, and music tracks. Hosted on Azure, the platform benefits from Microsoft's cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security. This combination of Angular, ASP.NET, MySQL, and Azure, along with the underlying use of TypeScript and C#, makes the Music App a comprehensive solution for music playlist management, catering to the needs of both casual listeners and avid music collectors.
